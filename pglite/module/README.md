## Developing

This module was generated with `pgpm init` in a **PGlite** workspace. Its tests run against in-process [PGlite](https://pglite.dev) (WASM Postgres) via [`pglite-test`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pglite-test) — no Postgres server, no Docker.

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run tests (in-process PGlite — nothing else to start)
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch
```

The same `deploy/` / `verify/` / `revert/` scripts also run unchanged on a real Postgres server via `pgsql-test`.

### PGlite notes

- **Roles.** `getConnections()` seeds the standard app roles (`anonymous`/`authenticated`/`administrator`/`authenticated_client`), so `db.setContext({ role })` works out of the box. Opt out with `pglite: { roles: false }` to manage your own (see the [`pglite-test`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pglite-test) docs).
- **Extensions.** WASM extensions (e.g. pgvector via `@electric-sql/pglite-pgvector`) are registered at construction with `pglite.extensions` and installed with `CREATE EXTENSION` in `extensionSql` — pgpm's `cleanSql` strips `CREATE EXTENSION` from migrations, so they're provisioned out-of-band.
- **In-memory by default.** Persist with `getConnections({ pglite: { dataDir: './.pglite' } })`.
